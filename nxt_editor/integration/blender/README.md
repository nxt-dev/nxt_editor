# Installation
**This is an experimental version of nxt_blender. Save early, save often.**  
This is a Blender addon for nxt. Note that it will access the internet to install.  
_In some of our testing we found that we needed to install Python on 
the system inorder for Blender to be able to open the NXT editor. If you 
get strange import errors when you try to import `nxt_editor`, try 
installing Python (same version as Blender's) on your machine._

### By hand (if you're familiar with pip)
1. Locate the path to blenders Python interpreter
    - In Blender, you can run `sys.exec_prefix` to find the folder containing the Python executable
2. Open Terminal or CMD (If you're using Windows)
3. Run: `/path/to/blender/python.exe -m pip install nxt-editor`
4. Start Blender
5. Open the addon manager (Edit > Preferences > Add-ons)
6. Click "Install" and select the `nxt_blender.py` file provided with this addon zip
7. To launch NXT navigate the newly created `NXT` menu and select `Open Editor`


### Automated
1. Open the addon manager (Edit > Preferences > Add-ons)
2. Click "Install" and select the `nxt_blender.py` file provided with this addon zip
3. Enable the `NXT Blender` and twirl down the addon preferences
3. Click `Install NXT dependencies`
   - The installation may take a minute or two, during this time Blender will be unresponsive
   - Optionally open the console window before running the script, so you can see what's happening
4. Restart Blender
