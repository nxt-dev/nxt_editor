# Maya FBX Export
To get the example scene and export graph open simply do the following:
1. Open `man/anim/data/base/walk/man_base_walk_anim.ma` in Maya
2. Open the NXT editor in Maya
3. In NXT open the graph `man/anim/data/export_fbx.nxt`

You can now export the animation by executing the graph. Click around to the various nodes to read their comments and code to get a taste for how the graph works.
